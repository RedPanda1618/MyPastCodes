# ImageProcessing

## ForcusImg.py
You can take a screenshot and then create and display
an image in real time that shows only the spotlight
on the area where the mouse pointer is.

I am planning to implement it with a C++ program using OpenGL.

GPU mode is not recommended.
Since it is not yet optimized, the CPU is faster at computing.
